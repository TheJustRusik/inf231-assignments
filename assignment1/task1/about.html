        My name is TheJustRusik and I am an author. It has taken me a while to admit this. I started this blog because I wanted to write, so I wrote about many different things, but over time the blog has become focussed on the act of writing and self-publishing. This doesn’t mean I’m anti- traditional publishing but I have little experience of it.
        I rarely, if ever, talk about how to write, but I often talk about everything around it. Luckily, a few people have found my thoughts valuable (I ignore the ones that don’t).
        Disclaimer: I limit myself to spending only one hour on each post, plus a bit of extra time for editing, because I prefer to concentrate on writing my fiction. However, this does mean you may find the odd typo or grammatical error. I blame my fingers.
        To date I have released two books of my Transcendence Trilogy and am currently working on the third. I may occasionally talk about them. To find out more about them, please click on the links below:
